       "'If you are getting the error \"invalid reference format: repository name must be lowercase\" when working with Docker on Windows, here are some steps you can try to resolve the issue:\\n\\n1. **Move Data to a Folder Without Spaces**:\\n    - Ensure your code or data is located in a folder path without spaces. For example, move your code from `“C:/Users/Alexey Grigorev/git/…”` to `“C:/git/…”`.\\n\\n2. **Modify the Volume Mapping Command**:\\n    - Replace the `-v` part in your Docker command with one of the following options to specify the volume correctly:\\n\\n    ```\\n    -v /c:/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\\n    -v //c:/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\\n    -v /c/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\\n    -v //c/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\\n    --volume //driveletter/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data/:/var/lib/postgresql/data\\n    ```\\n\\n3. **Add `winpty` if Using `docker run -it`**:\\n    - If you are using `docker run -it`, try adding `winpty` before your command:\\n    \\n    ```\\n    winpty docker run -it \\\\\\n    -e POSTGRES_USER=\"root\" \\\\\\n    -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=\"root\" \\\\\\n    -e POSTGRES_DB=\"ny_taxi\" \\\\\\n    -v /c:/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data \\\\\\n    -p 5432:5432 \\\\\\n    postgres:13\\n    ```\\n\\n4. **Use Quotes Around Volume Paths**:\\n    - Add quotes around the volume paths in the command:\\n    \\n    ```\\n    -v \"/c:/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\"\\n    -v \"//c:/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\"\\n    ```\\n\\n5. **Use `$(pwd)` for Current Directory Path**:\\n    - Use `$(pwd)` to refer to the current directory path with quotes in the command:\\n    \\n    ```\\n    -v \"/$(pwd)/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\"\\n    ```\\n\\nIf none of these options work, you can also use a named volume instead of a path:\\n\\n```\\n-v ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\\n```\\n\\nThese steps should help resolve the \"invalid reference format: repository name must be lowercase\" error when working with Docker volumes on Windows.'"

       "'It appears that you are facing issues connecting to your Postgres instance on port 5432 due to password authentication failure. Here are a few steps to resolve this issue based on the provided CONTEXT:\\n\\n1. **Check Port Conflict**:\\n   - You might have another instance of Postgres running on port 5432. A common solution is to change the port mapping to a different one (e.g., 5431):\\n     ```bash\\n     docker run -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=root -p 5431:5432 postgres\\n     ```\\n   - When connecting, ensure you are using the correct port. For example:\\n     ```python\\n     create_engine(\\'postgresql://root:root@localhost:5431/ny_taxi\\')\\n     ```\\n\\n2. **Verify Username and Password**:\\n   - Ensure that the username and password you are using are correct. The error message suggests it is a password authentication error. Double-check the credentials in your connection string.\\n\\n3. **Check and Stop Local Postgres Service**:\\n   - If Postgres is also installed locally on your machine, it might be interfering. On Windows, you can check if there is a service running Postgres:\\n     - Go to Services in Windows (`services.msc`).\\n     - Look for a Postgres service and stop it.\\n\\n4. **Docker Service Check**:\\n   - Ensure your Docker container is running properly by checking the container status:\\n     ```bash\\n     docker ps\\n     ```\\n   - You can access your Docker container and check current users:\\n     ```bash\\n     docker exec -it <your_container_name> /bin/bash\\n     su - postgres\\n     psql -c \"\\\\du\"\\n     ```\\n\\n5. **Debugging on macOS**:\\n   - Use the `lsof` command to check if port 5432 is being used by another process:\\n     ```bash\\n     lsof -i :5432\\n     ```\\n   - If you need to stop the local Postgres service, use:\\n     ```bash\\n     launchctl unload -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.postgresql.plist\\n     ```\\n   - To restart it:\\n     ```bash\\n     launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.postgresql.plist\\n     ```\\n\\nFollowing these steps should help you address the connection issue you are experiencing with Postgres on port 5432.'"
